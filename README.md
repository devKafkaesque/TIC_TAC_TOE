# React Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. This project showcases fundamental React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and handling user interactions. The game is designed to be easy to play with a clean and responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Two-player Gameplay**: The game supports two players who can alternate turns between 'X' and 'O' to mark the grid.
- **Winning Conditions**: The game automatically detects a winner when any player aligns three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can easily reset the game to start a new round.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and can be played on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

To get started with the React Tic-Tac-Toe application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-tic-tac-toe
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play the game!

## Usage

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns clicking on an empty square to place their mark (either 'X' or 'O').
- The game will automatically declare the winner or a draw once a player has completed the winning conditions.
- You can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Restart Game" button.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Custom CSS is used to style the game board and interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core game logic, including detecting the winner and managing the state, is written in JavaScript.

## Future Improvements

- **AI Player**: Implement an AI player using minimax algorithm for single-player mode.
- **Game History**: Keep track of all previous game moves and allow players to replay or view past games.
- **Player Names**: Allow users to set custom player names instead of using 'X' and 'O'.
- **Styling Enhancements**: Improve the styling and animations for a more polished user experience.
